# Salary-Prediction
This project builds a regression model to predict salaries based on various features. It evaluates performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score, achieving high accuracy (R² = 0.98). The model helps in estimating salaries with minimal error, making it useful for HR analytics, job market analysis, and salary forecasting.
